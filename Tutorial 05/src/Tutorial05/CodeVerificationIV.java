// There are two versions of processA, java chooses which overloaded method to call based on the parameter types, Since Num1 is a double and Num2 is an int, this matches the first version; It adds 3 to 2, because Java calls the method processA(double, int) â€” which does addition
// Java decides which method to call based on the types of the arguments passed, In your main method, you wrote:Num1 is a double and Num2 is an int, So Java looks for a method with this exact match in parameter types

// To make both methods return int, change return type to 'int' and cast the result before returning
